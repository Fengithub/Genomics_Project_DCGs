# Identifying Differentially Connected Genes of Breast Invasive Carcinoma in Co-expression

project done by Fen Pei and Seo-Jin Bang

This work aims to identify differentially connected genes (DCGs) that cause significant topological changes between 
two gene coexpression networks: breast invasive carcinoma versus normal samples.

Highlights:<br />
• Built two gene co-expression networks on breast invasive carcinoma versus normal samples based on public data
from TCGA<br />
• Proposed 4 DCG statistics to evaluate connectivity difference of each gene between two networks using the
differential network measures<br />
• Identified the top 20 DCGs and evaluated their enriched pathways and GO terms


Data: Breast invasive carcinoma dataset from The Cancer Genome Atlas ([TCGA](https://tcga-data.nci.nih.gov/tcga))
